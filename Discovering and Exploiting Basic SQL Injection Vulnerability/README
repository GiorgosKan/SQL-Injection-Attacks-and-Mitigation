Goal
The goal was to identify a basic SQL Injection vulnerability in DVWA and confirm that user input is directly injected into an SQL query.

Steps
The DVWA security level was set to Low.
The SQL Injection module was accessed through the browser.
A normal request with id=1 was submitted to observe expected behavior.
A basic SQL Injection payload was crafted.
The payload was encoded using https://www.urlencoder.org/
.

The HTTP request was intercepted using Fiddler.
The request was replayed using Replay → From Composer, modified, and executed.

Payload Used (plain text)
1' OR '1'='1


Payload Used (URL encoded)
1%27%20OR%20%271%27%3D%271


Result

The application returned multiple users instead of a single user, confirming that the SQL query was successfully manipulated.
What This Demonstrates
User input is not sanitized.
The SQL query can be altered by the attacker.
The application is vulnerable to SQL Injection.
